# IMATTC
A userscript overhaul for the [Ingress Mission Authoring Tool](https://mission-author-dot-betaspike.appspot.com/).

In order to use this, you'll need a browser with a userscript manager, such as [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/), and an [Ingress](https://ingress.com/) user account eligible to create missions.

[Download and Install](https://github.com/adinlead/IMATTC/raw/master/IMATTC.user.js)

**IMATTC is not currently supported in Greasemonkey.** It is suggested you use this Tampermonkey for now. If you have experience working with scripts in Greasemonkey, [I would not be averse to some help fixing this](https://github.com/andyjennings314/IMATTC/issues/9).

## Getting Started

When you first load the mission editor with IMATTC installed, you'll find all your missions, sorted alphabetically.

You can easily make use of the mission editor like this (just use the "Perform Mission Actions" button to pull them up), but you may want to use the categories to sort your missions into banners, or other groupings. First, hit the "Create New Category" button, and choose a name:

The script will create your new category, and automatically drop all your other missions into "Unsorted Missions". The next step is to add missions to your categories, and this has been made super easy in the latest version of this script - just click and drag the missions you want into the category! You can even click and drag them to reorder their default sorting within the category.

Lastly, there's even a button at the top of each category, to preview its contents as a banner:
